## which bonus i did?

-   Search bar - searching every letter without button.
-   I used with Sweet Alert to notify and contact with the user.
-   Use with local storage - for consistent list. The local storage save tasks, tasks I did, list name, background image.
-   A button that gives us the option to delete all saved science, and start a new list.
-   Undo button - use with array. According to the principle - the last to enter is the first to leave.
-   A button that gives us the option to rename the list.
-   A button that gives us the option to change the background image.
-   I uploaded the app to the Vercel site [my app](https://my-to-do.vercel.app/).
